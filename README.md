Small experiments arounds algorithms but also around unit testing, promises in clojurescript and shadow-cljs

## Usage

From the browser

```
scripts/dev

open public/index.html
```

From node

```
scripts/dev-node

scripts/run
```

In both cases, hot reloading is active, i.e. changes to files will be automatically compiled and the tests will be rerun.
